# Email Telegram Alerts

## Description
This code reads email from your Gmail inbox and sends alerts to your Telegram bot. 
It currently only supports Gmail. This project is useful for ensuring timely replies to important emails from specific senders, as the default email client may not always deliver notifications promptly.

## Installation

To get the Telegram bot token, you can contact the BotFather bot on Telegram. For Gmail login, you will need to generate an app password from Google Account > Settings > Security > 2-Step Verification > App Passwords > Generate Password. You can use any relevant name for the app and use the generated password in the .env file.

1. Install dependencies using `pnpm i`.
2. Create a `.env` file and add the relevant values. You can refer to the `.env.sample` file for the same.

## Usage

Start the project using `pnpm start`.
